# Newton-Raphson method
This is a project for Mathematical Concepts Visualisation.
There are 4 java files:
Complex.java: represents points in complex plane.
Polynomial.java: represents complex polynomials.
Newton.java: given an initial Complex point z0 calculates the corresponding root of Polynomial by Newton-Raphson, if possible.
NewtonFractal.java: will generate a fractals.
