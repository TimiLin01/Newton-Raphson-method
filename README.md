# Newton-Raphson method
This is a project for Mathematical Concepts Visualisation. 
To understand Newton's method.

There are 4 java files:

Complex.java: represents points in complex plane.

Polynomial.java: represents complex polynomials.

Newton.java: given an initial Complex point z0 calculates the corresponding root of Polynomial by Newton-Raphson, if possible.

NewtonFractal.java: will generate a fractals.

Fractal-dark.png, Fractal-light.png and fractal-dark.png,fractal-light.png are the results of 2 examples.
